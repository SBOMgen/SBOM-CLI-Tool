{"id": "CVE-2023-49293", "package": "npm:vite", "purl": "pkg:npm/vite@4.4.9", "package_type": "npm", "package_usage": "optional", "version": "4.4.9", "fix_version": "4.4.12", "severity": "MEDIUM", "cvss_score": "5.0", "short_description": "# Vite XSS vulnerability in `server.transformIndexHtml` via URL payload\n### Summary\nWhen Vite's HTML transformation is invoked manually via `server.transformIndexHtml`, the original request URL is passed in unmodified, and the `html` being transformed contains inline module scripts (`<script type=\"module\">...</script>`), it is possible to inject arbitrary HTML into the transformed output by supplying a malicious URL query string to `server.transformIndexHtml`.\n\n### Impact\nOnly apps using `appType: 'custom'` and using the default Vite HTML middleware are affected. The HTML entry must also contain an inline script. The attack requires a user to click on a malicious URL while running the dev server. Restricted files aren't exposed to the attacker.\n\n### Patches\nFixed in vite@5.0.5, vite@4.5.1, vite@4.4.12\n\n### Details\nSuppose `index.html` contains an inline module script:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\">\n\t// Inline script\n</script>\n```\n\nThis script is transformed into a proxy script like\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"/index.html?html proxy&index=0.js\"></script>\n```\n\ndue to Vite's HTML plugin:\n\nhttps://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/7fd7c6cebfcad34ae7021ebee28f97b1f28ef3f3/packages/vite/src/node/plugins/html.ts#L429 L465\n\nWhen `appType: 'spa' | 'mpa'`, Vite serves HTML itself, and `htmlFallbackMiddleware` rewrites `req.url` to the canonical path of `index.html`,\n\nhttps://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/73ef074b80fa7252e0c46a37a2c94ba8cba46504/packages/vite/src/node/server/middlewares/htmlFallback.ts#L44 L47\n\nso the `url` passed to `server.transformIndexHtml` is `/index.html`.\n\nHowever, if `appType: 'custom'`, HTML is served manually, and if `server.transformIndexHtml` is called with the unmodified request URL (as the SSR docs suggest), then the path of the transformed `html proxy` script varies with the request URL. For example, a request with path `/` produces\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"/@id/__x00__/index.html?html proxy&index=0.js\"></script>\n```\n\nIt is possible to abuse this behavior by crafting a request URL to contain a malicious payload like\n\n```\n\"></script><script>alert('boom')</script>\n```\n\nso a request to http://localhost:5173/?%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27boom%27)%3C/script%3E produces HTML output like\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"/@id/__x00__/?\"></script><script>alert(\"boom\")</script>?html proxy&index=0.js\"></script>\n```\n\nwhich demonstrates XSS.\n\n### PoC\n\n\tExample 1. Serving HTML from `vite dev` middleware with `appType: 'custom'`\n\t\t\tGo to https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs vite 9xhma4?file=main.js&terminal=dev html\n\t\t\t\"Open in New Tab\"\n\t\t\tEdit URL to set query string to `?%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27boom%27)%3C/script%3E` and navigate\n\t\t\tWitness XSS:\n\t\t\t![image (https://user images.githubusercontent.com/2456381/287434281 13757894 7a63 4a73 b1e9 d2b024c19d14.png)\n\tExample 2. Serving HTML from SSR style Express server (Vite dev server runs in middleware mode):\n\t\t\tGo to https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs vite 9xhma4?file=main.js&terminal=server\n\t\t\t(Same steps as above)\n\tExample 3. Plain `vite dev` (this shows that vanilla `vite dev` is _not_ vulnerable, provided `htmlFallbackMiddleware` is used)\n\t\t\tGo to https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs vite 9xhma4?file=main.js&terminal=dev\n\t\t\t(Same steps as above)\n\t\t\tYou should _not_ see the alert box in this case\n\n### Detailed Impact\n\nThis will probably predominantly affect [development mode SSR (https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr#setting up the dev server), where `vite.transformHtml` is called using the original `req.url`, per the docs:\n\nhttps://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/7fd7c6cebfcad34ae7021ebee28f97b1f28ef3f3/docs/guide/ssr.md?plain=1#L114 L126\n\nHowever, since this vulnerability affects `server.transformIndexHtml`, the scope of impact may be higher to also include other ad hoc calls to `server.transformIndexHtml` from outside of Vite's own codebase.\n\nMy best guess at bisecting which versions are vulnerable involves the following test script\n\n```js\nimport fs from 'node:fs/promises';\nimport * as vite from 'vite';\n\nconst html = `\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n\t<head>\n\t\t<meta charset=\"UTF 8\" />\n\t</head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<script type=\"module\">\n\t\t\t// Inline script\n\t\t</script>\n\t</body>\n</html>\n`;\nconst server = await vite.createServer({ appType: 'custom' });\nconst transformed = await server.transformIndexHtml('/?%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27boom%27)%3C/script%3E', html);\nconsole.log(transformed);\nawait server.close();\n```\n\nand using it I was able to narrow down to #13581. If this is correct, then vulnerable Vite versions are 4.4.0 beta.2 and higher (which includes 4.4.0).\nUpgrade to version 4.4.12 or later", "related_urls": [], "occurrence_count": 0, "reachable_flows": 0}
